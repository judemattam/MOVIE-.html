<p> Action film is a film (type of writing or art) in which the main character or main characters are thrust into a series of challenges that usually include violence, extended fighting, physical feats, and rushing and upset chases. Action films tend to feature a clever hero struggling against amazing odds, which include life-threatening situations, an evil person, or a pursuit which generally ends/decides in victory for the hero (though a small number of films in this (type of writing or art) have ended in victory for the evil person instead). (times of moving ahead or up) in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that needed/demanded the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past. <p>		


I will be showing you some famous films that contain a lot of action scenes.
